This is a demo for testing our algorithm 
"Concise and effective network for 3D human modeling from orthogonal sihouettes".

(1) The main function is in demo_real.py.
    It has thress parameters.
    Default output position:
            output_dir = './Image/'
    front and side view images as a list
            img_filenames = ['./Image/5front.jpg', './Image/5side.jpg']
    Body height is specified(m)
            body_height = 1.6

    The final result is 'name.obj', in the Image file.
